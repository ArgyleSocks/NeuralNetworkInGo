Backpropagation: the nightmare begins
# PREVIOUSest probem:
Integrating dict has been quite the adventure
We need to create code that formats sampleSet conveniently with dict (sampleArrangement does not work with alternate formats)
  Two options:
   - We omit sampleArrangement for the time being (easiest option)
   - We create additional code that formats the samples we want to be trained into the prescribed two-dimensional array
This piece of crap needs organization NOW
